##ECR Scardypantz
ECR Scardypantz works for Professor Manel and they have followed a traditional academic trajectory. They are aware that they have engaged in what asome might call "questioable research practices", but they have only used them to create the  a narative necessary to effectively convey their work. Scardypantz is concerned that engaging in Open Science will limit their freedom to explore their data and slow down their progress.
