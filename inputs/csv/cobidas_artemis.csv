 3 & 4 - if the triggers are not delivered to amplifiers, but to the acquisition computer, select the appropriate option 3 or 4 depending on whether the trigger is transfered using an analogue (e.g. parallel port) or digital (e.g. USB) channel
 6. If triggers are added after the recording (e.g. after analysis of an audio recording of spoken responses), select option 6.
