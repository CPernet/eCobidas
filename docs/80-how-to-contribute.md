There are many ways in which you can contribute to this project.

We have a list of
[milestones](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/cobidas_chckls/milestones) for the
different features we would like to include in this project.

Those milestones have
[several opened issues](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/cobidas_chckls/issues)
related to them: have a look through those issues to see if there is any of them
where you think you can help.

We are also track the progress to our different goals using some of the
integrated [kanban boards](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/cobidas_chckls/projects)
that github offers.

> They are a great way to keep track of who is doing what, how the different
> tasks of your project are moving along...
