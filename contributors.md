## Contributor biographies

### Federico Adolfi

### Rémi Gau

I am a post doc at the Université Catholique de Louvain la Neuve in Belgium. I investigate on multisensory integration and mostly rely on high-resolution fMRI for my work. I also have a small thing for open-transparent-reproducible science.

### Cassandra Gould van Praag

I am a postdoc at the University of Oxford Department of Psychiatry in the [Psychopharmacology and Emotion Research Laboratory](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/research/psychopharmacology-and-emotion-research-laboratory). I support (f)MRI research across the [Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre Experimental Medicine theme](https://oxfordhealthbrc.nihr.ac.uk/research/clinical-research-infrastructure-and-experimental-medicine/), where I help researchers design, execute and analyse awesome experimental medicine investigations. I am passionate about bringing inexperienced researchers into the world of programming and Open Research through excellent documentation and accessible resources.
